## üéØ The Problem

Local artisans are masters of their physical craft but often lack the time, resources, or confidence to be effective digital marketers. They struggle to write product descriptions that capture the soul of their work, create engaging social media content, and tell their unique story in a crowded online world. As a result, their incredible work often goes undersold and their stories remain untold.

## ‚ú® Our Solution

**Hearth & Bound** is a purpose-built web application that acts as a personal marketing assistant for the creative community. By simply uploading an image of their work and providing a few keywords, artisans can instantly generate a full suite of ready-to-use marketing materials. We handle the storytelling so they can focus on creating.
